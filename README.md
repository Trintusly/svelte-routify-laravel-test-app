# svelte-routify-laravel-test-app

This is a compendium of the frontend & backend of a scrapped/test project that I made a while ago to test out SPA architecture using Laravel & Routify V3 Beta (a Svelte SPA framework) just to know how to work along with these sorts of technologies.

Needless to say I have learned a lot thanks to these amazing pieces of software, so I am making this public so maybe it helps someone in the future.

The code isn't something you should be using as is, as it is not refined & the files are not organised at all. It is preferable if you use this as a resource only.
